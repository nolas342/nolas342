👋 Hey! I’m Nour

🤓 I’m into pretty much anything tech — software dev, hardware tinkering, embedded systems… if it has wires or code, I’m in.

🚀 I’m currently studying engineering with a focus on embedded software systems, and I’m always building random projects to level up.

🧠 I love mixing hardware + software: Flutter apps, IoT devices, robotics… that’s my vibe.
